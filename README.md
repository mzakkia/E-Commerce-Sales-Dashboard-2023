This dashboard i made as a bootcamp mini project. So i was given a dataset to answer and visualize a set of questions:

1. What was the total sales in 2023? 
2. How many transactions occurred in 2023? 
3. How many unique customers were there?
4. What was the daily total sales trend in 2023? 
5. Provide a list of the top 10 products with the highest total sales!
6. What is the proportion of total sales by segment? 
7. Which product category had the highest total sales? 
8. Total sales by country?

After answering and visualizing the answers, here are the insights and my recommendations:

1. The **Fashion category** is the top revenue driver (**$5.2M**), **allocate more marketing and inventory resources** here to keep the products sold high and reach bigger market size.
2. Because The **Corporate segment** contributes significantly (**30.2%**), consider **B2B promotions** or **bulk purchase discounts**.
3. The USA dominates the market, but there are opportunities in emerging markets such as **Mexico** and **Australia**, therefore we can **expand the promotion effort** in these high potential countries.
4. Nearly the same number of customers and transactions suggests a **low repeat rate**. Consider making **loyalty programs** to **encourage repeat purchase order**.
5. T-Shirts, Watches, and Running Shoes perform best, we can consider **bundling**, **upselling**, or **cross-selling** these products.
